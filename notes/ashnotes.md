# Notes from first Ash Application

## Overall 

- Very ambitious project 
- Would be super cool if it works 
- Learning curve is high
- Documentation is very good 

## Documentation 

- The dynamic library list is clever 
- Maybe too clever
- But it's complicated to access and use 
- The settings dissapear when you start a new session
- Either let the settings be persistent with a cookie, or get rid of the dynamic inclusion

## Formatter 

- The formatter didn't work for me.  (Neovim & ElixirLS)
