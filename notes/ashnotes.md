# Notes from first Ash Application

## Overall 

- Ash is ambitious 
- Learning curve is high
- Documentation is good 

## Documentation 

- The dynamic library display is maybe too clever 
- Complicated to access and use 
- The settings dissapear when you start a new session
- Either let the settings be persistent with a cookie, or get rid of the dynamic display
